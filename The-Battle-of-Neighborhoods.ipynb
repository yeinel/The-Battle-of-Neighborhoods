These data will be loaded from the address http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data with the help of the python requests module**\n\nIt must be prepared and cleaned to apply the algorithms that we will need:\n\n1. First of all we will be working with all Boroughs that are necessary and provide value.\n2. To be able to use the wikipedia data, the first thing is to extract the table with the Borough information and convert it into a dataframe so that we can work with the data as we need it. We will do this with the help of the BeautifulSoup python module\n3. We will also eliminate all rows that have the value of \"Not assigned\" since they do not generate value.\n4. In the case of neighborhoods that have the value of \"Not assigned\" they will be assigned the same value as the \"Borough\" data.\n5. The similutud and differences will be based on the Boroughs, therefore we will group the Borough data and concatenate the values for each neighborhood.\n6. To be able to perform explorations with the Forsquare API we will need to cross the data with the coordinates dataset. The merge of the data will be done through the Postcode column.\n7. With the clean data for both New York and Toronto we can continue with the analysis of the data, the visualization to verify the current distribution of the data, train our machine learning model to generate the clusters and find the differences and similarities between Both cities.\n",
